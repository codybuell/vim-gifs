Tabs
====

:tabnew        ->  open a new buffer in a new tab
:tabnew [file] ->  open file in a new tab
gt             ->  *GO TAB* next
gT             ->  *GO TAB* previous
{i}gt          ->  *GO TAB* i
:tab ball      ->  place each open buffer in a new tab

                   As you edit a bunch of different files and switch back and
                   forth, as long as you don't close vim, all the files are
                   actually still open in the buffer.  `:tab ball` places each
                   open buffer into a tab.

:tabmove {i}   ->  move the curret tab to position i
:tabs          ->  list all tabs
:tabonly       ->  close all tabs except the current
